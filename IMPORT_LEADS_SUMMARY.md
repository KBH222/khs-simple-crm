## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Run Setup Script
```bash
node setup-import-leads.js
```
This handles database and directory setup automatically.

### 2. Integrate Backend (server.js)

Add these two lines to `server.js`:

```javascript
// Near top (around line 15)
const importLeadsRoutes = require('./routes/import-leads');

// After other routes (around line 250)
app.use('/api/import-leads', importLeadsRoutes);
```

### 3. Integrate Frontend (index.html)

Copy from `public/import-leads-page.html` and paste into `public/index.html`:

**In `<head>` section:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="import-leads.css?v=20250101000000">
```

**In dashboard `nav-grid`:**
```html
<div class="nav-card" data-page="import-leads" onclick="showPage('import-leads')">
  <!-- Copy full card from import-leads-page.html -->
</div>
```

**In `<main>` after existing pages:**
```html
<div id="import-leads" class="page">
  <!-- Copy full page from import-leads-page.html -->
</div>
```

**Before closing `</body>`:**
```html
<script src="import-leads.js?v=20250101000000"></script>
```

### 4. Update app.js

Add this to the `showPage()` function:

```javascript
if (pageId === 'import-leads') {
  loadImportLeads('pending');
}
```

### 5. Test It!

```bash
# Create sample leads
node test-import-leads-sample.js

# Start server
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3001
# Navigate to Dashboard → Import Queue
```
